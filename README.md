On Dart Web Programming - Exercise 5

Use [two Dart files](https://github.com/dzenanr/two_files), 
one to define all functions, 
the other to prepare function arguments. 
The print function may be used only in the prepare functions. Follow [Dart Style Guide](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/).

1.  Validate if a text has only letters (and spaces).

2.  In a String variable there are sentences with different lengths. Write a function that finds the longest sentence.

3.  Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence.

4.  Create a function that handles the times table for any number. Check the function with the 8 times table.

5.  Write a function that displays, in a balanced way, a tree with any height. 
```
For example, a tree with the height of 5,
        *            
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
```

```
or the height of 6.
        *            
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
   ***********
```
